## 🎓 About Me

Recent Master's graduate in Computer Engineering from Vistula University (GPA: 4.4) with a strong foundation in embedded systems, cloud technologies, and data analytics. I'm passionate about building innovative solutions that bridge software engineering excellence with data-driven insights.

**Current Focus:**
- **Embedded Systems & Avionics** – Aircraft fault detection, predictive maintenance, and system optimization
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** – Scalable, resilient AWS-based solutions and cost optimization
- **Data Analysis & Machine Learning** – Building intelligent systems for complex problem-solving
- **Cybersecurity & Forensics** – Secure systems, cryptography, and ethical hacking

I actively seek entry-level roles in **software engineering**, **data analysis**, and **cloud engineering** where I can apply my technical expertise to drive innovative projects.
